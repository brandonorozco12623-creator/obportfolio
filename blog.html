                            For this project, I worked on a website for a client of mine, an upcoming musician. After giving me a document describing what he wanted out of his website, I was able to create a repository on Github and connect it to VSCode to begin my work. With the knowledge on how to use AI for this project, I began by creating reports and references; essentially, I'd have Copilot create a report on information I give it, then I'd have it create a reference file or folder to use going forward. This way, hallucinations and forgetfulness from the AI is avoided. The rest is the work of precise and descriptive prompting, usage of deterministic outcomes as goals, and research on outside sources to enhance Copilot's knowledge and the website's look overall.

He very well understood the responsibility of creating a professional & creative website that would be seen by many, and he was able to deliver high-quality results within a very timely matter.

After this experience, I am most definitely a returning customer and I would highly recommend Brandon's services to anyone looking to empower their websites with his expertise!"

                            This is a website I created to see how I could explore AI's understanding of UX Design; in this case, I wanted to see how it could handle the Luxury Typography style. Creating this website was quite easy, seeing as I started off with a large and detailed prompt to set up the site for a swift and efficient execution on the AI's behalf. That prompt consisted of getting Copilot to create a workflow folder containing backlog and sprint folders, along with getting the AI to conduct extensive research on luxury typography and create reports for it to use as references. With that, Copilot was ready to create a first draft of the website at my request, and the process continued. I made sure to include my calendly link and email for contact information, gave Copilot orders to conduct technical debt audits on the website and ensure mobile compatibility, and soon enough the website you see here was finished.
